# real-time-object-detection-with-automated-whatsapp-alerts-using-dl

### Real-Time Object Detection with automated whatsApp alerts using Twilio and deep learning... This project helps someone who owns a place and needs monitoring at the least cost.

### Abstract:
The Human Detection and WhatsApp Alert System is an AI-driven security solution that utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection to identify human presence in real-time. The system captures live video from a webcam, detects humans, and upon detection, takes a screenshot and sends an automated WhatsApp alert via Twilio API.

## Required things
* **Python** - for overall project script.
* **Computer Vision** - for webcam management, screenshots, recording, saving the media.
* **YOLO (YOU ONLY LOOK ONCE)** - for object detection.
* **Deep Learning** - for yolo.
* **Twilio** - for sending alerts through WhatsApp.
* **Pywhatkit** - for sending alerts through WhatsApp.
* **ngrok** - for giving public URLs to the local media files.
* **apache server** - for giving public URLs to the local media files.
* **shutil** - for moving files

### Python
* **Role:** Python is the primary programming language used to write the entire script. It acts as the backbone of the project, integrating all the components and libraries.
* **Usage:** Python is used for:
      Webcam management (using OpenCV),
      Object detection (using YOLO),
      Sending WhatsApp alerts (using Twilio),
      File management (using shutil), and
      Executing additional scripts (e.g., Emergency_act.py).

```bash
python --version
```
```bash
 pip install 
```
