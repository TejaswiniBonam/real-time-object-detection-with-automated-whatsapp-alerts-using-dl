# YOLO (You Only Look Once)
## What is YOLO?
* YOLO is a Deep Learning Model designed for **Object Detection**
* Before Knowing YOLO, we need to understand **Deep Learning, Computer Vision, CNN, and Object Detection**

# Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which itself is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI).
# Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform specific tasks without explicit programming. 
Instead of being programmed with specific rules, machine learning models learn from data, identifying patterns and making predictions or decisions based on that data.

Machine learning relies on data to train models. This data can be structured (like tables) or unstructured (like images or text).

Various algorithms are used in machine learning, including linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and clustering algorithms. Each algorithm has its strengths and is suited for different types of problems.

## Supervised learning:

You show a child different animals and tell them the names (Dog, Cat, Elephant). After seeing many examples, the child learns to identify them on their own.

**How it works in AI:**
The computer is trained on labeled data (data with correct answers).
It learns by comparing its predictions with the correct labels and improves over time.
**Real-world examples:** 
* Spam Detection – Email systems learn which emails are spam (labeled as spam or not).
* Face Recognition – A phone unlocks by recognizing a specific face.
* Loan Approval – Banks predict if a person will repay a loan based on past data.
> The machine learns from examples with correct answers (labeled data).

## Unsupervised Learning
You give a child a basket of mixed fruits but don’t tell them their names. The child starts grouping similar-looking fruits together (apples with apples, bananas with bananas) even though they don’t know the names.

**How it works in AI:**
The computer is given data but without labels (no correct answers).
It finds similar hidden patterns and groups (clusters).
**Real-world examples:**
* Customer Segmentation – E-commerce sites group customers based on shopping behavior.
* Anomaly Detection – Detecting fraudulent transactions in banks.
* Market Basket Analysis – Stores find which products are frequently bought together.
> The machine finds patterns and groups in data without knowing the correct answers.

## Reinforcement Learning
Imagine teaching a dog to fetch a ball. If the dog brings the ball back, you reward it with a treat. If it doesn’t, no treat. Over time, the dog learns that fetching the ball earns a reward.

**How it works in AI:**
The computer learns by interacting with an environment.
It tries different actions and receives rewards or penalties based on the outcome.
Over time, it learns the best strategy to maximize rewards.  
**Real-world examples:**
* Self-driving Cars – Learn to drive by trying different moves and avoiding crashes.
* Game AI (like Chess or Go) – AI plays games, learns strategies, and beats humans.
* Robotics – Robots learn to walk by adjusting their movements through trial and error.
> The machine learns by making mistakes, receiving rewards, and improving its actions over time.
